# Assignment 2: Work with Bitmap Images.

## Objective
1. Implement a **flood fill algorithm** 
2. Implement a **blur effect**

## Part 1: Flood Fill Algorithm

### Description
The flood fill algorithm starts from a given pixel and fills all neigbour pixels of the same color with a new color until it encounters a boundary color. Use a `std::queue`  and a `visited` 2-d array.
Assume the maximum image size is 1000x1000 pixels. 

Hint: Define the `visited` globally.

Assume a struct color values of r,g, b.

```c++ 
struct color{
    uint8_t r;
    uint8_t g;
    uint8_t b; 
};
```

### Pseudo Code for Non-Recursive Flood Fill with `visited`
```plaintext
function floodFill(image, startX, startY, fillColor):
    if startX or startY is out of image bounds:
        return
    startColor = image.getPixel(startX, startY)
    // You need to compare red with red, green with green and blue with blue
    if startColor == fillColor: 
            return
    create an queue and add (startX, startY) to it
    create a 2D array `visited` of size (MAX_SIZE, MAX_SIZE) initialized to false
    mark (startX, startY) as visited
    while the queue is not empty:
        (x, y) = remove the first element from the queue
        mark visited[x][y] to true
        if image.get_pixel(x, y) == startColor:
            image.set_pixel(x, y, fillColor)
            for each neighbor (nx, ny) of (x, y):
                if nx and ny are within image bounds and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    add (nx, ny) to the queue
                    mark (nx, ny) as visited
```

## Part 2: Square Blur Effect

### Description
The square blur effect smooths the image by replacing each pixel's color with the average color of all pixels within a square neighborhood of a specified size. 

### Pseudo Code for Square Blur
```plaintext
function applySquareBlur(image, blurSize):
    create a temporary image (blurredImage) as a copy of the original image
    halfSize = blurSize // 2
    for each pixel (x, y) in the image:
        totalR = 0, totalG = 0, totalB = 0
        count = 0
        for dy from -halfSize to halfSize:
            for dx from -halfSize to halfSize:
                nx = x + dx
                ny = y + dy
                if nx and ny are within image bounds:
                    neighborColor = image.getPixel(nx, ny)
                    totalR += neighborColor.r
                    totalG += neighborColor.g
                    totalB += neighborColor.b
                    count += 1
        averageColor = (totalR / count, totalG / count, totalB / count)
        blurredImage.setPixel(x, y, averageColor)
    
```

## Code
You can use the header file from the class [bmp.hpp](../code/bmp/bmp.hpp).
You can use the samples bitmap images, [sample](sample.bmp), and [sample1](sample2.bmp) to test your code.

# Project 
you can work in groups of 3.


## Grading Criteria

### Flood Fill
1. Correct implementation of the non-recursive flood fill algorithm using a `queue` and `visited` matrix.
2. Proper handling of boundary conditions.

### Square Blur
1. Correct implementation of the square blur algorithm.
2. Proper handling of image boundaries.
3. Ability to adjust blur size.

Bonus: if you compute the Square Blur code in a constant time regadress of the size of blur.
