#  Line Drawing and Gradient Coloring

## **Part A — Drawing a Line Using Integer Arithmetic**

### **1. Concept**

A straight line between two points
$$
(x_1, y_1) \text{ and } (x_2, y_2)
$$
can be described mathematically by the equation
$$
y = m x + b
$$
where ( m = $$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$).

A naïve algorithm computes `y` for each step in `x` using floating-point arithmetic.
Although simple, this approach suffers from rounding errors, uneven pixel placement, and high computational cost due to multiplication and division operations.

### **2. Floating-Point Method (Conceptual Description)**

1. Compute the slope ( m ) and intercept ( b ).
   $$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$ \\
   $$ b=y1​−mx1​ $$
   
3. Step through all integer values of `x` between `x1` and `x2`.
4. For each step:

   * Compute ( y = m x + b ).
   * Round ( y ) to the nearest integer pixel.
   * Draw a pixel at `(x, round(y))`.

**Limitations:**

* Requires floating-point division and multiplication.
* Cumulative rounding errors can skip or duplicate pixels.
* Works well only when the slope magnitude is less than 1 unless extra handling is added.

### 3. Integer Optimization (Bresenham’s Approach) (Bonus) 

Bresenham’s algorithm replaces all floating-point operations with **integer addition and subtraction** by introducing an **error accumulator**.

#### **Key Idea**

* Maintain an integer variable that measures how far the plotted point is from the true line.
* Increment the error each time a step is made along the major axis.
* When the error exceeds a threshold, step once along the minor axis and correct the error.

#### **Algorithmic Logic**

1. Compute the absolute horizontal and vertical distances (`dx`, `dy`).
2. Determine the step directions in `x` and `y`.
3. Initialize the error term as `err = dx - dy`.
4. Plot the starting pixel `(x1, y1)`.
5. Repeat:

   * Update the error term based on twice its current value.
   * If the doubled error exceeds `-dy`, move one step in `x` and adjust the error.
   * If the doubled error is less than `dx`, move one step in `y` and adjust the error.
   * Continue until the endpoint `(x2, y2)` is reached.

#### **Why It’s an Optimization**

* Avoids all floating-point arithmetic.
* Uses only integer additions, subtractions, and comparisons.
* Produces perfectly connected lines for all slope directions.
* Operates in linear time proportional to the number of pixels in the line.

#### **Applications**

* Low-level graphics (framebuffers, rasterizers)
* Embedded or microcontroller displays
* Efficient drawing routines for games or simulations

## **Part B — Gradient Coloring of a Rectangle**

### **1. Concept**

A gradient fill gradually changes color across a surface.
For a rectangular region, the color at each pixel is **interpolated** between two or more reference colors.

Typical example:

* Left edge color → `(r1, g1, b1)`
* Right edge color → `(r2, g2, b2)`

The fill color of each pixel is a weighted blend based on its position.

### **2. Gradient Computation Principle**


> **Note:** You are free to use other the gradient effect.  
> For example, you might experiment with different interpolation formulas


For a horizontal gradient:

$$
\begin{aligned}
R &= r_1 + (r_2 - r_1) \cdot \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
G &= g_1 + (g_2 - g_1) \cdot \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
B &= b_1 + (b_2 - b_1) \cdot \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Each pixel’s color depends on how far it lies between the two edges.

### **3. Integer Interpolation Optimization**

To avoid floating-point operations, replace the fractional ratio
$$
\frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
with an **integer-scaled fraction**, such as:
$$
t = \frac{(x - x_1) \times 255}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
and use integer arithmetic to interpolate each color channel.

This allows smooth gradients computed entirely with integer math, using addition and multiplication only.

### **4. Algorithmic Description**

1. Determine the rectangular region boundaries: `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.
2. For each pixel position `(x, y)` inside the rectangle:

   * Compute the interpolation factor `t` based on horizontal position.
   * Calculate the red, green, and blue components using integer interpolation.
   * Set the pixel color using `set_pixel(x, y, R, G, B)`.
3. Repeat for every scanline until the rectangle is filled.
